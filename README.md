Objectives: (https://github.com/mattsteffey/Project1/blob/master/README%20images/Gameplay.png)
The object of the game is for your character(s) to fly their airplanes, up and down along the Y-Axis on the left hand side of the screen, and use fire upon the rapidly approaching meteors that are falling onto the city below. 

The object of the game is to destroy a certain number of meteors in a race against time. Upon sucessfully defending the city below, your hero will have unlocked the final phase of the game. In this phase, another race against time will present itself in the form of a boss fight. Do you have what it takes to take down the last boss?
